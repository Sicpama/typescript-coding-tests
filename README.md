- **Runs multiple test cases** against your solution automatically
- **Provides detailed feedback** showing expected vs actual results
- **Handles errors gracefully** with clear error messages
- **Supports various data types** including numbers, strings, arrays, and objects
- **Real-time validation** as you write and test your code

### How to Use Tests

1. **Write your solution** in the Monaco code editor
2. **Click "Run Tests"** to execute your code against all test cases
3. **Review the results** to see which tests passed or failed
4. **Iterate and improve** your solution based on the feedback
5. **All tests pass?** Move on to the next question or challenge
